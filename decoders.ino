/*
This file contains the various crank and cam wheel decoder functions.

Each decoder must have the following 4 functions (Where xxxx is the decoder name):

* triggerPri_xxxx - Called each time the primary (No. 1) crank/cam signal is triggered (Called as an interrupt, so variables must be declared volatile)
* triggerSec_xxxx - Called each time the secondary (No. 2) crank/cam signal is triggered (Called as an interrupt, so variables must be declared volatile)
* getRPM_xxxx - Returns the current RPM, as calculated by the decoder
* getCrankAngle_xxxx - Returns the current crank angle, as calculated b the decoder

And each decoder must utlise at least the following variables:
toothLastToothTime - The time (In uS) that the last primary tooth was 'seen'
*
